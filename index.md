<!--Greetings! I am currently a 6th-year PhD student in Seismology at University of Texas at Dallas. My supervisor is Prof. [Hejun Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dCUgUwYAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on investigating the radial and azimuthal anisotropy structure of Australian Plate using adjoint tomography. Here is my [CV](https://github.com/xueyanlipku/pdfs/blob/master/2-pages_cv.pdf).-->

<!--Inverted wave-speed perturbation throws light on the cratonic lithosphere thickness of continental Australia, as well as the slab morphology of surrounding subduction zones (Tonga-Kermadec-Hikurangi, New Hebrides and Java). Fast-axis direction of azimuthal anisotropy not only shows the frozen-in deformation within the lithosphere, but unveils the mantle flow in the upper mantle. This enables us to infer the dynamic process inside the Earth. -->

<!--In addition to my phd thesis research, I am also interested in resolution evaluation of seismic tomography, wave equation modeling and imaging techniques, as well as code optimization for scientific computing packages, e.g. [SPECFEM3D_GLOBE](https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/specfem3d_globe/). -->
