Greetings! I am currently a 5th-year PhD student in Seismology at University of Texas at Dallas. My supervisor is Prof. [Hejun Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dCUgUwYAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on investigating the radial and azimuthal anisotropy structure of Australian Plate using adjoint tomography. 

Inverted wave-speed perturbation throws light on the cratonic lithosphere thickness of continental Australia, as well as the slab morphology of surrounding subduction zones (Tonga-Kermadec-Hikurangi, New Hebrides and Java). Fast-axis direction of azimuthal anisotropy not only shows the frozen-in deformation within the lithosphere, but unveils the mantle flow in the upper mantle. This enables us to infer the dynamic process inside the Earth. 

In addition to my phd thesis research, I am also interested in resolution evaluation of seismic tomography, wave equation modeling and imaging techniques, as well as code optimization for scientific computing packages, e.g. [SPECFEM3D_GLOBE](https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/specfem3d_globe/).
